            <p>This project involves developing an advanced vehicle tracking system using Python and OpenCV. The system incorporates Car and MultiCar classes to monitor and update vehicle positions dynamically. It also implements features like direction detection, state management, and age tracking to efficiently handle multiple vehicles with real-time updates and color differentiation.</p>
            
            <p>The vehicle tracking system aims to enhance traffic monitoring and management by providing accurate and real-time vehicle tracking data. It can be used for various applications, including traffic analysis, security, and automated toll systems.</p>
